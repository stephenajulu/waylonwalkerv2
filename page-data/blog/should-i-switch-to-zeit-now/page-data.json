In fact I have hosted about a dozen different toy projects to play with on there, 4 of which have gone far enough to get a custom domain name.  They are fast to deploy and consistently do so on every <code class=\"language-text\">git push</code> to main.</p>\n<h2>Zeit</h2>\n<p>I have recently started playing with zeit again.  I really like their cli tool, its dead simple and makes sense.  I tried the netlify one early on and dont think I really gave it much of a chance. I was able to backup a site we were modifying by saving everything locally (literally control+s) and running <code class=\"language-text\">now</code> in the command line.</p>\n<p>While I was on the site I realized that when switching to gatsby v2 I had deployed it to now.sh while testing, before cutting over to the updated one on netlify.  It has been building every version since without issue!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It has been building every version since without issue!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>What I am using</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>gatsby</li>\n<li>forestry.io</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am using gatsby to build my site, and I do use forestry.io as a cms to be able to edit/manage posts online.  I think forestry is part of my problem in that it has added extra builds.  Every time I upload an image or save a post, even a draft, it pushes to production.</p>\n<h2>Why Switch</h2>\n<p>This is just a side hobby for me.  I do not make any $$ off of it, and I do not want to pay for anything I do not have to.  As I am stepping up my blogging I have already hit 50% of my build quota only 1 week into the month on netlify.  I really like what netlify is doing for the JAMstack community, but I would rather build everything locally and push to GHPages for this project than have to pay for it.</p>\n<h2>What Are your suggestions</h2>\n<p>Do you use Zeit?</p>\n<p>Where do you host your gatsby.js site?</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/should-i-switch-to-zeit-now/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-02-06T22:38:00.000Z","devto_url":null,"devto_id":null,"title":"Should I switch to Zeit Now","description":"Should I switch to Zeit Now.
