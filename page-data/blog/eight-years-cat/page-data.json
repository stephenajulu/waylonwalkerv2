I have been very flexible in taking on a new career path. I have been eager to learn new things and respond to life changes that I never would have imagined.</p>\n<h2>Life Changes</h2>\n<p>Very severe chronic health issues from my family restricted my ability to travel to the facilities I served as a Mechanical Engineer. I was able to stay strong and make it work. But in the meantime, I was learning new skills that enabled me to be more effective remotely.</p>\n<h2>I was scared.</h2>\n<p>It was in these times that I found a love for data, and taking action from insights I found with data. I learned how to use python to enable me to be more effective. I did this primarily from hospital waiting rooms and many overnight stays. This gave my mind a break from some of the really difficult things in life but also catapulted my career in a new direction.</p>\n<p>üîº Be flexible\nüîº Always be open and ready for change\nüîº Never stop learning\nüîº Keep a positive attitude\nüîº Be kind to others</p>\n<hr>\n<p>This was originally posted on my LinkedIn, if you enjoy it please connect with me and give the post a üëç</p>\n<iframe src='https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:6679445409351393280' height='813' width='504' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen='' title='Embedded post'></iframe>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/eight-years-cat/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-06-19T05:00:00.000Z","devto_url":"","devto_id":"","title":"My first eight years as a working professional.","description":"This day 8 years ago I started my first day as a Mechanical Engineer.
